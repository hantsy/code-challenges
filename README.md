# Code Challenges in ...

In the past years, I have always tried to update myself on cutting-edge technologies. I defined a lot of learning paths or coding journeys to achieve the purpose.  I also tried to participate in some programs in Twitter hashtags, such as [#100DaysofCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode) to track my work.  Finally, I found most of them didn't work as expected due to the progress disturbed by some uncertain things in my life. 

I hope this repository will record some of my learning results in the future. 

This repository is not for showing you how to learn something or teaching you some new things. It is just my toys, it is truly coding for fun.  I will not follow the rules of any campaigns. In other words, I will add the work at my own pace. There are no deadlines or limitations like delivering a real-world project.
